AsmSample is a simple application that demonstrates how C and assembly languageroutines can interact with one another.The main program, written in C, calls an assembly language routine, passing ita parameter.The assembly language routine, calls a C routine, passing it a parameter.To build the sample without debug information, use:make -e -f AsmSample.make > AsmSample.makeoutAsmSample.makeoutTo build the sample suitable for debugging, use:make -e -f AsmSample.make -d SymOpt=on > AsmSample.makeoutAsmSample.makeout
