AsmSample is a simple application that demonstrates how C and assembly language
routines can interact with one another.

The main program, written in C, calls an assembly language routine, passing it
a parameter.

The assembly language routine, calls a C routine, passing it a parameter.


To build the sample without debug information, use:

make -e -f AsmSample.make > AsmSample.makeout
AsmSample.makeout

To build the sample suitable for debugging, use:

make -e -f AsmSample.make -d SymOpt=on > AsmSample.makeout
AsmSample.makeout
