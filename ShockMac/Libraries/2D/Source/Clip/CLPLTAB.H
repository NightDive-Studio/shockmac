Each   clipped line drawer would call the appropriate line clipper and   unclipped line drawer in whatever way it needed to for the kind of   clip.     NB: The vlin drawer can't easily call a clipper, since it is   compiled to be called from an interrupt.  It inlines the routine.   The hlin drawer also inlines it's clipper, since the fn call    overhead is significant.   (A stecil clipped line drawer might interleave clip and unclipped   line draw calls, for example.)*/#ifndef __CLPLTAB_H#define __CLPLTAB_H#include "plytyp.h"/* functions living in the vector */extern int gri_line_clip_fill (long, long, grs_vertex *, grs_vertex *);extern int gri_iline_clip_fill (long, long, grs_vertex *, grs_vertex *);extern int gri_cline_clip_fill (long c, long parm, grs_vertex *v0, grs_vertex *v1);extern int gri_sline_clip_fill (long c, long parm, grs_vertex *v0, grs_vertex *v1);extern int gri_hline_clip_fill (short, short, short, long, long);extern int gri_vline_clip_fill (short, short, short, long, long);extern int gri_wire_poly_line_clip_fill (long c, long parm, grs_vertex *v0, grs_vertex *v1);extern int gri_wire_poly_sline_clip_fill (long c, long parm, grs_vertex *v0, grs_vertex *v1);extern int gri_wire_poly_cline_clip_fill (long c, long parm, grs_vertex *v0, grs_vertex *v1);/* actual clippers */extern int gri_line_clip (grs_vertex *, grs_vertex *);extern int gri_cline_clip (grs_vertex *, grs_vertex *);extern int gri_sline_clip (grs_vertex *, grs_vertex *);/* these are implemented, but are not used */extern int gri_hline_clip (short *, short *, short *);extern int gri_vline_clip (short *, short *, short *);#endif
