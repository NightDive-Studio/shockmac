See test/clintest.c   See also note.txt for argument for correctness and precision safety   of current algorithm.*//* NB: directionality policy -- reversible   Lines are drawn in order of increasing x or increasing y,    for lines that have greater x or y extent, repsectively.   This is done for all lines, including horiz., vert., and    45' lines (increasing x).*/ /* NB: endpoint policy -- inclusive     The left and top endpoints are inclusive, i.e. 'trunc'-ed.  The    right and bottom endpoints exclude the ceiling.  This is    calculated by subtracting epsilon (i.e. 1/65536) from its    fixed-point representation, then trunc'ing.        This makes sense if you note that open interval on right          < ceil (x)      is the same as         <= trunc (x - e)    This means that it might not be necessary to go through the ugliness   of swapping endpoints, but I'm not convinced that there aren't    precision problems involved.  Since wire-poly's overdraw, it's   really necessary to ensure that the same points are always drawn.*/   fix x0, y0, x1, y1;   fix dx, dy;			/* deltas in x and y */   fix t;                       /* tmp */   uchar r0, g0, b0, r1, g1, b1;
