The two weights are purity and opacity,respectively. (Apologia: Averaging the two factors insequentially like this may seem strange, but I foundit to be more intuitive than any other system I couldthink of. Opacity means exactly what it sounds like, andfilter purity only applies to the light coming through.)Increasing the opacity of the frammice will make it lookcloudier, whereas increasing the purity will make itlook more strongly colored.  Put a green frammice on ared background. If it has high opacity, it will begreen. If it has low opacity but high purity, it willbe black, as no red light gets through.  If it has lowopacity and low purity, it will be transparent andtherefore look red. Somewhere in the middle of all this,it will look brown, which is probably what you want.*/#include <string.h>#include "fix.h"#include "grs.h"#include "scrdat.h"#include "rgb.h"#include "tlucdat.h"#include "tluctab.h"#include "lg.h"// convert red in a glomped rgb to a fixed point #define rtof(b) ( ((b)&0x3ff)<<12)// convert green in a glomped rgb to a fixed point #define gtof(b) ( ((b)&0x1ff800)<<1)// convert blue in a glomped rgb to a fixed point #define btof(b) ( ((b)&0xffc00000)>>10)#define WHITE (0x7fff)/* Note: RGB values are 6-bit. *//* Fills table with groovy values, and incedentally returns it. */uchar *gr_init_translucency_table(uchar *p, fix opacity, fix purity, grs_rgb color){   grs_rgb background;   int i;   fix r, g, b;   fix baser, baseg, baseb; /* surface component */   fix filterr, filterg, filterb; /* translucent component before addition of background */   fix filter, clarity;   long thingge;   baser = fix_mul(rtof(color), opacity);   baseg = fix_mul(gtof(color), opacity);   baseb = fix_mul(btof(color), opacity);   filter = fix_mul(0x10000 - opacity, purity);   clarity = 0x10000 - opacity - filter;   filterr = clarity + (fix_mul(rtof(color), filter) >> 6);   filterg = clarity + (fix_mul(gtof(color), filter) >> 6);   filterb = clarity + (fix_mul(btof(color), filter) >> 6);   for (i=0; i<256; i++) {      background = grd_bpal[i];      r = fix_mul(rtof(background), filterr) + baser;      g = fix_mul(gtof(background), filterg) + baseg;      b = fix_mul(btof(background), filterb) + baseb;      thingge = gr_index_rgb(r<<2, g<<2, b<<2);      p[i] = grd_ipal[thingge];   }   return p;}uchar *gr_init_lit_translucency_table(uchar *p, fix opacity, fix purity, grs_rgb color, grs_rgb light){   grs_rgb background;   int i;   fix r, g, b;   fix baser, baseg, baseb; /* surface component */   fix filterr, filterg, filterb; /* translucent component before addition of background */   fix filter, clarity;   long thingge;   filter = fix_mul(0x10000 - opacity, purity);   clarity = 0x10000 - opacity - filter;   filterr = clarity + (fix_mul(rtof(color), filter) >> 6);   filterg = clarity + (fix_mul(gtof(color), filter) >> 6);   filterb = clarity + (fix_mul(btof(color), filter) >> 6);   baser = fix_mul(fix_mul(rtof(color), rtof(light)), opacity) >> 6;   baseg = fix_mul(fix_mul(gtof(color), gtof(light)), opacity) >> 6;   baseb = fix_mul(fix_mul(btof(color), btof(light)), opacity) >> 6;   for (i=0; i<256; i++) {      background = grd_bpal[i];      r = fix_mul(rtof(background), filterr) + baser;      g = fix_mul(gtof(background), filterg) + baseg;      b = fix_mul(btof(background), filterb) + baseb;      thingge = gr_index_rgb(r<<2, g<<2, b<<2);      p[i] = grd_ipal[thingge];   }   return p;}uchar *gr_init_lit_translucency_tables(uchar *p, fix opacity, fix purity, grs_rgb color, int n){   int k;   grs_rgb light;   if (n == 0) return NULL;   for (k=0; k<n; k++) {      light = grd_bpal[grd_screen->ltab[k*256+grd_ipal[WHITE]]];      gr_init_lit_translucency_table(p+256*k, opacity, purity, color, light);   }   return p;}int gr_dump_tluc8_table(uchar *buf, int nlit){   uchar *p;   int k, lsize = nlit*256;   p = buf;   p += sizeof(int);   *(p++) = nlit;   *(p++) = tluc8nstab;   LG_memcpy(p, tluc8stab, tluc8nstab*256);   for (k=0; k<256; k++) {      if (tluc8tab[k]) {         *(p++) = k;         LG_memcpy(p, tluc8tab[k], 256);         p += 256;         LG_memcpy(p, tluc8ltab[k], lsize);         p += lsize;      }   }   *(int *)buf = p-buf;   return p-buf;}void gr_read_tluc8_table(uchar *buf){   uchar *p, *end;   int lsize, k;   end = buf + *(int *)buf;   p = buf + sizeof(int);   lsize = *(p++) * 256;   tluc8nstab = *(p++);   tluc8stab=p;   p += 256*tluc8nstab;   while (p < end) {      k = *(p++);      tluc8tab[k] = p;      p += 256;      if (lsize) tluc8ltab[k] = p;      p += lsize;   }}
