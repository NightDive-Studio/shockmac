Don't use a union since I want to    be able to initialize as automatic.   LINES, ILINES, ULINES and CLINES take a vertex interface (fix pt coord)      For these, the conversion to vertex is cheap relative to the overall   cost and needed for rgb and i values.  (ILINES is converted, it does   fix-pt internally.)   HLINES and VLINES take an xy interface   (short coord)      For these, these take short args and are used for speed and    for lots of calulations on the arglements (e.g. menues).   Unfortunately, they now take 5 params (3 points and 2 parms).      Fill parm last, hpoing compiler notices it's not always used.*/typedef   void *grt_uline_fill;typedef   void (*grt_uline_fill_v) (long, long, grs_vertex *, grs_vertex *);typedef   void (*grt_uline_fill_xy) (short, short, short, long, long);typedef   void (*grt_wire_poly_uline) (long, long, grs_vertex *, grs_vertex *);typedef   void (*grt_wire_poly_ucline) (long, long, grs_vertex *, grs_vertex *);typedef     grt_uline_fill grt_uline_fill_table[GRD_FILL_TYPES][GRD_LINE_TYPES]; #define grt_wire_poly_usline grt_wire_poly_ucline;extern grt_uline_fill *grd_uline_fill_vector;#endif
