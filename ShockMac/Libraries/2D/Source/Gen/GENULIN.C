It lives in    the uline_fill_table and is accessed via the line_fill_vector. *//* Draw an unclipped fixed-point line with calls to    grd_upixel_fill -- this fills in the pixel according to the   current fill type (in the grd_pixel_fill_table) *//* NB: directionality policy -- reversible   Lines are drawn in order of increasing x or increasing y,    for lines that have greater x or y extent, repsectively.   This is done for all lines, including horiz., vert., and    45' lines (increasing x).*/ /* NB: endpoint policy -- inclusive     The left and top endpoints are inclusive, i.e. 'trunc'-ed.  The    right and bottom endpoints exclude the ceiling.  This is    calculated by subtracting epsilon (i.e. 1/65536) from its    fixed-point representation, then trunc'ing.        This makes sense if you note that open interval on right          < ceil (x)      is the same as         <= trunc (x - e)    This means that it might not be necessary to go through the ugliness   of swapping endpoints, but I'm not convinced that there aren't    precision problems involved.  Since wire-poly's overdraw, it's   really necessary to ensure that the same points are always drawn. */void gri_gen_uline_fill (long c, long parm, grs_vertex *v0, grs_vertex *v1){   fix x0, x1, y0, y1;        /* actually use x and y */   fix dx, dy;		      /* delta's in x and y */   fix t;                     /* temporary fix */      x0 = v0->x; y0 = v0->y;   x1 = v1->x; y1 = v1->y;   /* set endpoints      note that this cannot go negative or change octant, since the ==      case is excluded */   if (x0 < x1)       x1 -= 1;			/* e.g. - epsilon */   else if (x0 > x1)      x0 -= 1;      if (y0 < y1)      y1 -= 1;	   else if (y0 > y1)       y0 -= 1;    dx = fix_trunc (x1) - fix_trunc(x0);	/* x extent in pixels, (macro is flakey) */   dx = fix_abs (dx);   dy = fix_trunc (y1) - fix_trunc(y0);	/* y extent in pixels */   dy = fix_abs (dy);   if (dx == 0 && dy == 0)      return;   /* three cases: absolute value dx < = > dy            the variable (x0 or y0) for the long dimension is treated as a fix      and incremented using ++, the other is kept as fixpoint and       incremented by the fixpoint delta (dx or dy).
